:User clicks on destination on map;

-> Server receives MOVE_CHARACTER_AT_WORLD event;
:Server calls handleMoveCharacterAtWorld(socket, movesTo);
:Server updates character's movesTo coordinate;
note right
    Character's movesTo coordinate is set to destination.
end note
-> Server sends MOVE_CHARACTER_AT_WORLD event back to client with movement data;

:Server starts movement loop;

    :Server calls moveCharacter(characterId);
    if (Distance to movesTo <= step size?)
        :Server sets character's coordinates to movesTo;
        :Server clears character's movesTo;

        :Server updates character's coordinates towards movesTo;
